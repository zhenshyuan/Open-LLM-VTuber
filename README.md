> :warning: This project is in its early stages and is currently under **active development**.

> :warning: If you want to run the server remotely and access it on a different machine, such as running the server on your computer and access it on your phone, you will need to configure `https`, because the microphone on the front end will only launch in a secure context (a.k.a. https or localhost). See [MDN Web Doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia). Therefore, you should configure https with a reverse proxy to access the page on a remote machine (non-localhost).



## ⭐️ What is this project?


**Open-LLM-VTuber** is a unique **voice-interactive AI companion** that not only supports **real-time voice conversations**  and **visual perception** but also features a lively **Live2D avatar**. All functionalities can run completely offline on your computer!

You can treat it as your personal AI companion — whether you want a `virtual girlfriend`, `boyfriend`, `cute pet`, or any other character, it can meet your expectations. The project fully supports `Windows`, `macOS`, and `Linux`, and offers two usage modes: web version and desktop client (with special support for **transparent background desktop pet mode**, allowing the AI companion to accompany you anywhere on your screen).

Although the long-term memory feature is temporarily removed (coming back soon), thanks to the persistent storage of chat logs, you can always continue your previous unfinished conversations without losing any precious interactive moments.

In terms of backend support, we have integrated a rich variety of LLM inference, text-to-speech, and speech recognition solutions. If you want to customize your AI companion, you can refer to the [Character Customization Guide](https://open-llm-vtuber.github.io/docs/user-guide/live2d) to customize your AI companion's appearance and persona.

The reason it's called `Open-LLM-Vtuber` instead of `Open-LLM-Companion` or `Open-LLM-Waifu` is because the project's initial development goal was to use open-source solutions that can run offline on platforms other than Windows to recreate the closed-source AI Vtuber `neuro-sama`.

This project underwent code refactoring after version `v1.0.0` and is currently in active development, with many exciting features coming soon! 🚀 Check out our [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/t41372/projects/1/views/5) to learn about update plans.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Please refer to the [Quick Start](https://open-llm-vtuber.github.io/docs/quick-start) section in our documentation for installation.



## ☝ Update
> :warning: `v1.0.0` has breaking changes and requires re-deployment. You *may* still update via the method below, but the `conf.yaml` file is incompatible and most of the dependencies needs to be reinstalled with `uv`. For those who came from versions before `v1.0.0`, I recommend deploy this project again with the [latest deployment guide](https://open-llm-vtuber.github.io/docs/quick-start).

Please use `uv run update.py` to update if you installed any versions later than `v1.0.0`.

## 😢 Uninstall  
Most files, including Python dependencies and models, are stored in the project folder.

However, models downloaded via ModelScope or Hugging Face may also be in `MODELSCOPE_CACHE` or `HF_HOME`. While we aim to keep them in the project's `models` directory, it's good to double-check.  

Review the installation guide for any extra tools you no longer need, such as `uv`, `ffmpeg`, or `deeplx`.
